# 🗣️ Personal Linguistics Repository

Welcome to my **Personal Linguistics Repository** — a structured collection of notes, exercises, resources, and experiments aimed at improving my **English language skills**. This project serves as both a learning journal and a reference for linguistic exploration, particularly in grammar, vocabulary, pronunciation, and usage.

## 📚 Purpose

The main goals of this repository are:

- To systematically **enhance my English fluency** in both written and spoken forms.
- To document my **progress and challenges** in learning English.
- To explore **linguistic concepts** including syntax, semantics, phonetics, and pragmatics.
- To build a **personal reference** of rules, exceptions, examples, and exercises.

Making this public holds me accountable and opens opportunities to:
